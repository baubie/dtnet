Requirements
============
- Boost 1.47+
- Readline
- GLE (For graphing)

Installation
============
$ ./configure
$ make
$ sudo make install

Options are available for configure to specify installation location and library locations if configure is unable to find them on their own.
Type ./configure --help for more information.

Post-Installation
=================
Before dtnet can be used, you MUST create a file called ~/.libdtnetrc
In this file, add the following line:

models=HH aEIF Poisson

This tells dtnet which neural models are available


Running Examples
================
Examples are included in the examples diretory to reproduce the figures in Aubie et al. (2009). For example, to reproduce the figures generated by bandpass.dtnet (Figures are documented within each .dtnet file), simply enter the examples directory and run:

# dtnet -s bandpass.dtnet

Ensure GLE is installed and working in order for the figures to be produced. If GLE throws errors or a seg fault occurs, ensure you have adequate memory (at least 4GB of RAM is required for many simulations).
